3 Possible Ideas

1: A maze through Miami. It would be a way to tell the story of historic Miami. Objects found along the way would help the player with hints on which way to go and so on.

2: A game about cats in the city sliding things off of tables/buildings/other things. The player would earn depending on the size of the object that the cat pushes. The main cat can collect other cats for strength to push off bigger things like a piano or car.

3: Language learning -- a scene where you can click on different objects and the name of it would appear in French. You would also be able to hear the correct pronounciation and record your own so you can compare the two after. This would help people say things correctly.

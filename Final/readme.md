###3 Possible Ideas

1: A maze through Miami. It would be a way to tell the story of historic Miami. Objects found along the way would help the player with hints on which way to go and so on.

2: A game about cats in the city sliding things off of tables/buildings/other things. The player would earn depending on the size of the object that the cat pushes. The main cat can collect other cats for strength to push off bigger things like a piano or car.

3: Language learning -- a scene where you can click on different objects and the name of it would appear in French. You would also be able to hear the correct pronounciation and record your own so you can compare the two after. This would help people say things correctly.



###1st Code Plan

The game will be set up so that a person is walking back and forth at the bottom of the canvas. On the top portion of the canvas will be a cat that the user can move back and forth. This cat will be able to drop objects on the walking person when the user clicks on them. The user will gain points when the objects hit the person below.




###2nd Code Plan

The game allows to player to earn points by dropping objects on a pedestrian. The player can click anywhere on the canvas, which will trigger the cat to drop random office supplies. The player earns a point when the random office supplies collide with the pedestrian. On collision, the pedestrian walks faster which makes the game a little more difficult. 



###Library Tutorial

- Download your preferred library from p5js.org. For example, the p5.play library used in this project.

- Open the .zip file and look for the file ending in ".js". In this case, we will use the file "p5.play.js".

- Drag p5.play.js into the "addons" folder of your project.

- In the index.html, type in "<script src="../addons/p5.play.js"></script>" after all the scripts that are currently listed.

- You can now use your library. Refer to p5js.org for any documentation that applies to the library you are using.
